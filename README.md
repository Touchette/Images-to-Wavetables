## Installation
NOTE: You may have to enable audio on the VirtualBox Image if using one; if so, follow the steps after the installation steps:

Download the compressed application archive.

Move the archive to where you’d like to install the application; replacing “some/path/” with the desired installation path:

` > mv TeamA.tgz some/path/ `

Navigate to the directory containing the compressed application file; replacing “some/path/” with the path to the directory containing the TeamA.tgz file:

` > cd some/path/ `

Decompress the archive using tar:

` tar -xvzf TeamA.tgz `

Navigate into the application directory:

` > cd project2/ `

Run the precompiled executable:
	
` > ./ImagesToWavetables `

## Enabling Audio in Arch Guest (CIS Image)
Install the ALSA Utilities package to get alsactl and alsamixer:

` > sudo pacman -S alsa-utils `

Configure ALSA for the guest’s virtual audio devices:

` > sudo alsactl init `
` > sudo alsactl store `

Enable audio on the master chanel, open alsamixer and raise the volume of “master” using the arrow keys:
	
` > alsamixer `

Test the guest’s audio:
		
` > speaker-test `
